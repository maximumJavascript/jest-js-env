// NOTE: this is R&D task (research and develop)
// you are going to research how the code you write works and think about getting better solution
//
// there is no right answer, just recommendation and suggestion steps
// to done it: after every line you need to think or to do what you have been suggested, and only
// after that go to next line

// NOTE: what I expect in your PR on github:
// 0. Working with english language requirements (so I wrote everything on english)
// 1. some solution to the problems below
// 2. some tests you write to test your own code
// 3. resume or conclusion from you about using WeakSet, WeakMap, Set, Map, objects data structures

// 1. Try to figure out what whe written code doing
// 2. Do action with result:
//	2.1 sort immutable by updatedDate in non-ascending order
//  2.3 create data structure to show other news by every news item: it will be Map where
//  	keys will be these objects
//		values will be all objects with the same newsSite property value, but not including key
// 		object - use any structure you want
// 2.4 create function (or class) to add new value to this data
// structure:
// 	if Map already has that object as key, do nothing
// 	if Map does not have that object as key,
// 		but has another object with same id, update object in map with new object
// if we're adding completely new object - update collection properly try to write tests
// (check file articles.test.js) to check that it works correctly (NOTE: do NOT perform any
// requests in your tests, use fallbackData)
// 2.5 change Map to WeakMap
// 		can your code still work?
// Try to make it work by adding any non-weak data-structure you want to store data in and use
// 		WeakMap just for association between objects, not for data store (you want to get map
// 		association structure with auto-cleanable keys (because it is WeakMap) and your non-weak
// data store you write and change values) Think: keys are cleaning, but objects in value don't.
// Can you use WeakSet's as values to fix this issue? Does using WeakSet as values of WeakMap makes
// sense or not? Can you get associated data with it by key? Maybe you just don't need to store
// values as objects in you Map at all? Write function to get object by id in your non-weak data
// store and stop storing object in your map values - - store just ids, so objects can be
// garbage-collected if you remove it from data store adapt your tests to work with final solution

// FAQ
// Q: How can I write data to file myself to play with it?
// A: I suggest using this code
//
// import * as path from "path";
// import {fileURLToPath} from 'url';
// import * as fs from "fs";
//
// const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
// const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
//
// fs.writeFileSync(
// 	path.resolve(__dirname, './fallbackData.experimental.js'),
// 	'export default ' + JSON.stringify(result, undefined, 4),
// 	{},
// );
